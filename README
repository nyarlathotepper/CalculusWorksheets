This is a LaTeX-based worksheet generator for Calculus classes. My thanks to the Transitions Course group at Michigan State University, especially Russell Schwab, for allowing me access to their worksheet generator, which I have shamelessly copied. I also thank my colleagues Aditya Viswanathan, who pointed me towards MSU's resources, and Kelly Jabbusch, who graciously joined me in the task of indexing her worksheets for Calculus I. I also thank Autumm Caines for gently pushing me to get back to work on this project. 

Using the CalcMasterDoc file, you can search for worksheet problems using the tags indexed in either tags.tex or in the Master file itself. You can direct the Master file to match all or some of the tags you choose, or to show all the problems available. The comments in the Master file explain all!

If you create more tags, they need to be recorded in tags.tex and should, preferably, also be logged in the Master file for ease of use. You can also choose to include solutions or a diary, which I have not done due to sheer sloth. If you import any images, you should save them in the CalculusWorksheetGenerator folder and not a subfolder, or the Master will fail to recognize them when compiling. 

Enjoy!
